The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/marcelo-alvarez/halo2fluxmap

This version is modified so that it runs on python 3.x instead of 2.x

some parts need cosmolopy but the original cosmolopy is not compatible with python3.
You will have to clone from https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/CosmoloPy3

To run example:

    cd example
    python makecatalog.py
    python makemaps.py
    python showmap.py
